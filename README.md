# interval-filter

This is a module for the [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/) CMS that adds a custom filter. It will allow you to customize views with the concept of **interval** (or range). An interval is defined by a pair of fields representing the interval bounds.

The type of fields to be used as bounds are intentionally left unrestricted so that it can hopefully work in a wide variety of scenarios. The rule is: if it behaves correctly in the SQL context when applied to operators: `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`; then it will work as expected.
1) Add a new *Interval Filter* to a view.

2) Choose the operator (either *contains* or *not contains*)
3) Choose the fields to be used to be used respectively as MIN (left bound) and MAX (right bound).

The filter works as follows: It will check if the choosed value belongs (or not, depending on the operator) to the interval bounded by MIN and MAX. The fields MIN and MAX can also be *null*, this means that the interval is unbounded (either left or right or both).

**Example:** an item has MIN field = 100 and MAX field null. If value â‰¥ 100 and operator is *contains*, it will show that item.
